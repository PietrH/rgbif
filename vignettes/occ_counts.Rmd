It can sometimes be useful to know the number of occurrences for a country, species, basis of record, or year. With `occ_count()` it is possible to get simple occurrence counts for wide variety of queries.

Running `occ_count()` with no arguments will give the total number of occurrences mediated by GBIF.

``` r
occ_count() # should be over 2 billion!
```

`occ_count()` uses the same interface as `occ_search()`, so almost any query that works for `occ_search()` will work for `occ_count()`. In fact, `occ_count()` is just a short version of `occ_search(limit=0,occurrenceStatus=NULL)$meta$count`.

Below returns the total number of bird occurrences mediated by GBIF.

``` r
# should give the same result
occ_count(scientificName="Aves")
occ_search(scientificName="Aves",occurrenceStatus=NULL,limit=0)$meta$count
```

It is usually better to use **taxonKeys** rather than scientific names. Note the use of `;` for multiple values in the same query.

``` r
# name_backbone("Aves")$usageKey
occ_count(taxonKey=212)
# total count of birds and insects
occ_count(taxonKey="212;216")
```

It is possible to get counts by **country** or area using the appropriate 2-letter country code. See `enumeration_country()`.

``` r
# occurrences in Denmark
occ_count(country="DK")  
# occurrences in Denmark and United States
occ_count(country="DK;US") 
# occurrences in Denmark, United States, Mexico
occ_count(country="DK;US;MX") 

# number of occurrences published by the United States
occ_count(publishingCountry="US") 
# number of occurrences published by the United States and Japan
occ_count(publishingCountry="US;JP") 

# number of repatriated records in India
occ_count(repatriated = TRUE,country="IN") 

# number of insect occurrence records published by Japan
occ_count(taxonKey=216,publishingCountry="JP") 

# number of specimen insect occurrence records published by Japan bewtween the years 1900-2000
occ_count(publishingCountry="JP",basisOfRecord="PRESERVED_SPECIMEN",taxonKey=216,year="1900,2000")
```

Some `occ_search()` parameters accept a **range** of values, and these will also work for `occ_count()`. A `,` is used to define a range, such as `year="1900,2000"`.

> Note that 'year' means the year when the occurrence was recorded or collected, not when it was published to GBIF.

``` r
# number of occurrences between the years 
occ_count(year="1800,1900")
# In recorded or collected in 2023
occ_count(year=2023)

# all occurrences published with a coordinate uncertainty less than 10m
occ_count(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters = "0,10")

# close to a known iso2 centroid
occ_count(distanceFromCentroidInMeters="0,2000") 
# close to a known iso2 centroid in Sweden
occ_count(distanceFromCentroidInMeters="0,2000",country="SE") 
```

Note that `occ_count()` will **ignore missing values**, so if a publisher has not filled in a value, it will not be returned in the count. For example, it is common for occurrence publishers to leave the `coordinateUncertaintyInMeters` blank, but **not** very common to leave the coordinates fields empty.

``` r
occ_count(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters = "0,1000000")
occ_count(hasCoordinates=TRUE)
```

Here are some other interesting occurrence counts:

    # recorded by John Waller
    occ_count(recordedBy="John Waller") 
    # exactly on 0,0
    occ_count(decimalLatitude=0, decimalLongitude=0) 
    # published using DIGIR format
    occ_count(protocol = "DIGIR") 
    # with images
    occ_count(mediaType = 'StillImage') 
    # number of occurrences iucn status "critically endangered"
    occ_count(iucnRedListCategory="CR") 
    # counts by verbatim name supplied by the occurrence publisher
    occ_count(verbatimScientificName="Calopteryx splendens;Calopteryx virgo")
    # counts by WKT geometries 
    occ_count(geometry="POLYGON((24.70938 48.9221,24.71056 48.92175,24.71107 48.92296,24.71002 48.92318,24.70938 48.9221))")

There are some `occ_search()` queries that **do not** work. It's not possible to give `occ_count()` **multiple values** in the form `c("a","b")`. Since this will perform two separate request and get two separate counts. `occ_count` is designed to give back a single number, so querying with multiple values is not supported.

``` r
# will give ERROR 
# occ_count(scientificName=c("Calopteryx splendens","Calopteryx virgo")) 

# will work but will give the total count of both species. 
occ_count(scientificName="Calopteryx splendens;Calopteryx virgo")
```

## Using occ_counts\_\* functions

GBIF also has a few custom API endpoints for getting a **table** of useful occurrence counts. These can be accessed via the `occ_counts_*` family of functions.

`occ_counts_country()` will give back a table of total occurrence counts for each country or area.

| title                    | enumName      | iso2 | iso3 | isoNumerical | gbifRegion    |     count |
|:-------------------------|:--------------|:-----|:-----|:-------------|:--------------|----------:|
| United States of America | UNITED_STATES | US   | USA  | 840          | NORTH_AMERICA | 821428365 |
| France                   | FRANCE        | FR   | FRA  | 250          | EUROPE        | 136246772 |
| Canada                   | CANADA        | CA   | CAN  | 124          | NORTH_AMERICA | 134162884 |

`occ_counts_country(publishingCountry="MX")` will return a table of counts with countries were Mexico publishes occurrences records.

| title                    | enumName      | iso2 | iso3 | isoNumerical | gbifRegion    |    count |
|:-------------------------|:--------------|:-----|:-----|:-------------|:--------------|---------:|
| Mexico                   | MEXICO        | MX   | MEX  | 484          | LATIN_AMERICA | 21078158 |
| United States of America | UNITED_STATES | US   | USA  | 840          | NORTH_AMERICA |   124478 |
| Guatemala                | GUATEMALA     | GT   | GTM  | 320          | LATIN_AMERICA |    43327 |

`occ_counts_pub_country(country="MX")` will return a table of occurrence counts for each publishing country **about** Mexico. Note that the value for Mexico in this table will be the same as the one above.

See the examples below for more clarification:

``` r
# the occurrences Mexico has published in other countries 
occ_counts_country("MX") 
# the occurrences Denmark has published in other countries 
occ_counts_country("DK")
 
# the occurrences other countries have published in Denmark
occ_counts_pub_country("DK")
# the occurrences other countries have published in Mexico
occ_counts_pub_country("MX")
```

`occ_counts_year()` will return a table of total occurrence counts for each year that an occurrence was recorded or collected (**not** when published to GBIF).

| year |     count |
|:-----|----------:|
| 2023 |   2128333 |
| 2022 |  44899603 |
| 2021 | 230671677 |

`occ_counts_basis_of_record()` will return a table of occurrences counts for each basis of record type.

| basisOfRecord      |      count |
|:-------------------|-----------:|
| HUMAN_OBSERVATION  | 1967253952 |
| PRESERVED_SPECIMEN |  212934368 |
| MATERIAL_SAMPLE    |   51946547 |
| OBSERVATION        |   23398982 |
| OCCURRENCE         |   20362535 |
