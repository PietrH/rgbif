In order to use GBIF mediated data effectively, you will often need to match a scientific name to the [GBIF Backbone Taxonomy](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/d7dddbf4-2cf0-4f39-9b2a-bb099caae36c). 

The goal of **name matching** is to get back an unambiguous taxonomic key (a number) of the scientific name you are interested in. Having a key makes it easy for GBIF to know what you mean. 

`name_backbone` or `name_backbone_checklist` are the **best ways** to go from **scientific name** to **GBIF taxonkey**. 

```r
name_backbone(name="Calopteryx splendens") 
# name_backbone(name="Calopteryx splendens", verbose=TRUE)
```

This will return a `data.frame` of the **single best match** for the name you supplied.  

The most interesting columns are: 

* **usageKey**:  [Another name](https://discourse.gbif.org/t/understanding-gbif-taxonomic-keys-usagekey-taxonkey-specieskey/3045) for the GBIF taxonkey. 
* **status** : `name_backbone` will always return only "ACCEPTED" names. 
* **matchType** : "EXACT", "HIGHERRANK", "FUZZY", or "NONE" (see below).  
* **verbatim_name** : The name you supplied to GBIF. Useful for matching back to your original data. 

A matchType of **"HIGHERRANK"** usually means the name is not in the GBIF backbone or it is not a species-level name (a genus, family, order ...). A matchType of **"FUZZY"** means that the name you supplied may have been mis-spelled or is a variant not in the backbone. A matchType of **"Exact"** means the binomial name appears exactly as spelled by you in the GBIF backbone (note that it ignores authorship info).  

If you have **multiple names** to match, you can use `name_backbone_checklist`. 


```r 
# This requires the newest version of rgbif
name_list <- c(
"Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.", 
"Calopteryx splendens", 
"Puma concolor (Linnaeus, 1771)", 
"Ceylonosticta alwisi", 
"Fake species (John Waller 2021)", 
"Calopteryx")

name_backbone_checklist(name_list)
```

`name_backbone_checklist` will also work with a `data.frame` of name information also known as a **checklist**. 

```r 
name_data <- data.frame(
scientificName = c(
  "Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.", # a plant
  "Calopteryx splendens (Harris, 1780)", # an insect
  "Puma concolor (Linnaeus, 1771)", # a big cat
  "Ceylonosticta alwisi (Priyadarshana & Wijewardhane, 2016)", # newly discovered insect 
  "Puma concuolor (Linnaeus, 1771)", # a mis-spelled big cat
  "Fake species (John Waller 2021)", # a fake species
  "Calopteryx" # Just a Genus   
), 
kingdom = c(
  "Plantae",
  "Animalia",
  "Animalia",
  "Animalia",
  "Animalia",
  "Johnlia",
  "Animalia"
))

name_backbone_checklist(name_data)
# To return more than just the 'best' results, run
# name_backbone_checklist(name_data,verbose=TRUE) 
```

When using `name_backbone_checklist` with a `data.frame`, you can include higher taxonomic information (genus, family, order, phylum, kingdom, rank) as columns. The **'name'** column can also be one of **several commonly used aliases** (scientificName, sci_name, names, species, species_name, sp_name).


```r
name_data <- data.frame(
species = c(
  "Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.", # a plant
  "Calopteryx splendens (Harris, 1780)", # an insect
  "Puma concolor (Linnaeus, 1771)"
  ), 
 kingdom = c(
  "Plantae",
  "Animalia",
  "Animalia"
))

name_backbone_checklist(name_data)
```
## Too many choices problem 

When two or more names exist in the [GBIF Backbone Taxonomy](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/d7dddbf4-2cf0-4f39-9b2a-bb099caae36c) that have the **same name** but **different authorship,** (homotypic synonyms) supplying just the binomial name will result in `matchType : "HIGHERRANK"`. 

For example, the binomial name "Glocianus punctiger" has two entries in the backbone taxonomy. Using the `verbose=TRUE` will return both names. 

```
name_backbone("Glocianus punctiger",verbose=TRUE) # returns more names
# "Glocianus punctiger (C.R.Sahlberg, 1835)"
# "Glocianus punctiger (Gyllenhal, 1837)"
```

Giving just the binomial name will return the genus **Glocianus**, since GBIF doesn't know which one to choose. 

```r
name_backbone("Glocianus punctiger") # matchType : "HIGHERRANK"
```

Since `name_backbone` is designed to give back the best match, it's not possible for the response to choose between the two names. 

## Other name_* functions 

There are several functions for finding taxonomic information. Typically, the function you want to use is `name_backbone` or `name_backbone_checklist`, but these other functions can also be useful in certain situations.

`name_suggest` can be useful for looking up subspecies or partial names. It is the same service that lets [gbif.org](https://www.gbif.org) guess which name you are typing in the [occurrence search](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search).

```r
name_suggest("Calopteryx splendens")
```

`name_lookup` can be sometimes useful for seeing what is available in other checklists. 

```r
name_lookup("Calopteryx splendens")$data
```

`name_usage` is a catch all function that does a lot. `?name_usage` for more examples. 

For example, `name_usage` can be used for looking up all of the order, families, or genera in a higher-rank group. 

```r 
library(dplyr)
# all bird genera, families, and orders
name_usage(212,data="children",limit=200)$data %>% 
filter(!is.na(nubKey)) %>% # only things with a GBIF backbone nubKey
glimpse()
```

<!-- This is not typically necessary if you just want to make a download using the taxonkey, since a higher-rank taxonkey will automatically download all of the downstream species, genera, families ect in a group. See [here](https://discourse.gbif.org/t/understanding-gbif-taxonomic-keys-usagekey-taxonkey-specieskey/3045) for an explanation of GBIF taxonkey terms like **nubKey**.  -->

`name_usage` can be used for looking up the **common names** or **venacular names**. 

```r
name_usage(key=212, data="vernacularNames")$data # the common names for birds
```
