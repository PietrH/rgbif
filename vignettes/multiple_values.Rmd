There are some differences in how function across **rgbif** behave with respect to many values given to a single parameter. Typically as a user does need to worry about these details, but it can sometimes make a difference. 

```r
# multiple API requests 
occ_search(taxonKey=c(1,212))
occ_data(taxonKey=c(1,212))

# single API request 
occ_search(taxonKey="1;212"))
occ_data(taxonKey="1;212"))
```

These are the only two function in which the `;` separator will work.

Other **rgbif** functions, unlike those above, only support passing in many values to the **same HTTP request**, which is done like `c("1", "2")`, which is the opposite of how it was done above with the `;` separator. 


```r 
# for example
dataset_search(publishingOrg=c(
  "e2e717bf-551a-4917-bdc9-4fa0f342c530",
  "b8323864-602a-4a7d-9127-bb903054e97d")
  )
```

In general, it is best to read the documentation before assuming a function will accept multiple values.
